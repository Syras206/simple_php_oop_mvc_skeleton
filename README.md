# simple php oop mvc skeleton

This is a simple template for an opject oriented PHP MVC project.
This template is purposely simple and bare - it's a skeleton ready for you to build your own way.

There is no database logic, authentication or security, you'll just find emtpy classes ready for you to fill in.

This should be everything you need to structure your project and get you going.


## Installation

Just clone the repository and change the web root of your server to point to /public

## Router

Routes can be set in App/Core/routes.php
Have a look at the 'hello' example routes to get a feel for how they work.
